- **Containerization**:
  - Docker (standard and Raspberry Pi variants)

## Issues Identified

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Using outdated GitHub Actions versions (v3)
   - No caching for npm dependencies
   - No concurrency control for CI runs
   - No separate jobs for different tasks (lint, test, build)

2. **Documentation**:
   - Basic README.md but could be enhanced with more details
   - No contribution guidelines
   - No code of conduct
   - No issue templates

3. **Testing**:
   - Test setup exists but no test coverage reporting
   - No separate test job in CI

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Some dependencies could be updated to their latest versions
   - No Dependabot or Renovate for automated dependency updates

## Planned Improvements

1. **CI/CD Enhancements**:
   - Update GitHub Actions to latest versions
   - Add caching for npm dependencies
   - Implement concurrency control
   - Split jobs into separate workflows (lint, test, build, deploy)
   - Add conditional Docker builds

2. **Documentation**:
   - Enhance README.md with:
     - Better project description
     - Development setup instructions

   - Consider adding end-to-end testing

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Add Renovate for automated dependency updates
   - Update vulnerable dependencies

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Add pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting
   - Add commit message linting

## Next Steps

1. Implement CI/CD improvements
2. Update documentation
3. Set up test coverage reporting
4. Configure Renovate for dependency updates
5. Add pre-commit hooks
